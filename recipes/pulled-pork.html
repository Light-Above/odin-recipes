                </li>
                <li>
                    Pork: If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.
                </li>
                <li>
                Sauces: You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.

        <h3>
            Which Cut of Meat for Pulled Pork?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This recipe calls for a pork shoulder roast for a few reasons: It’s inexpensive, forgiving to work with, and tends to have a lot of marbling (which means it’ll result in tender pulled pork).
        </p>
        <h3>
            How to Make Puled Pork In the Slow cooker
        </h3>
        <p>
            Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade pulled pork in the Crock-Pot:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Pour oil into the slow cooker, then place the roast on top of the oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the remaining ingredients to the Crock-Pot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover and cook until the pork shreds easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shred the pork and return it to the slow cooker to combine it with the juices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you’re making sandwiches, serve the pulled pork on buttered buns.
                </li>
        <h3>

            How to Reheat Pulled Pork
        </h3>
        <p>
            To ensure the pulled pork doesn’t dry out, we recommend reheating it in the oven or in the slow cooker instead of the microwave. Make sure to save the juices so you can reheat them with the pork.
